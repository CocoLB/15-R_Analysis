# MPG Regression

## Multiple Linear Regression
    - vl = vehicle length
    - sa = spoiler angle
    - vw = vehicle weight
    - gc = ground clearance

We perfomred a Multiple Linear Regression to try to link 
mpg with the other variables.

lm(formula = mpg ~ vl + vw + sa + gc + AWD, data = mechaCarMpg)

Coefficients:
              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) -1.040e+02  1.585e+01  -6.559 5.08e-08 ***
vl           6.267e+00  6.553e-01   9.563 2.60e-12 ***
vw           1.245e-03  6.890e-04   1.807   0.0776 .  
sa           6.877e-02  6.653e-02   1.034   0.3069    
gc           3.546e+00  5.412e-01   6.551 5.21e-08 ***
AWD         -3.411e+00  2.535e+00  -1.346   0.1852 

The value Pr(>|t|), like the p-value, needs to be under 0.05 to show a significant impact.
We can see that in this instance, only vl (vehicle length) and gc (ground clearance) have a
significant impact on mpg. So the linear model could be written:
        mpg = -0.0104 + 6.267*vl + 3.546*gc + e

Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

R-squared at 0.7 and the p-value minimal show that this model is strong, and can predict
mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. There's definite corelation 
between mpg, and vl and gc.

The Pearson Corelation Coefficients, 0.6 for vl and 0.3 for gc, confirm this result.

## Linear Regression
As both vl and gc have an impact on mpg, we performed a single linear regression on each of them
so we can visualize both correlations, which we can't do for a multiple linear regression.


# Suspension Coil Summary

## Summary - missing var and sdv, but showing quartiles
    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.

## Summary Statisctics Table
    statsLabels        statsResults
                     
    1 min                       1452   
    2 max                       1542   
    3 mean                      1499   
    4 median                    1500   
    5 variance                  62.3 
    6 standard deviation        7.89

The summary statisctics, as well as the density plot, show that the distribution is almost normal,
with close mean and median.  The 1st quartile is high, almost at mean value, and the 3rd quartile is low,
just over the median, hence the low standard deviation. These results can be seen in the boxplot, which
shows a low variance (calculated at 62.3 pounds per inch) - under the limit of 100 needed by
the design specification. We can then asure that the current manufacturingh data meets this criteria.


# Suspension Coil T-Test

We notice similarities between the plots of the whole population and a sample of 50. We then performed
a one-sample T-Test:

        One Sample t-test

        data:  samples$PSI
        t = -0.28533, df = 49, p-value = 0.7766
        alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1498.78
        95 percent confidence interval:
        1496.367 1500.593
        sample estimates:
        mean of x 
        1498.48 

The p-value is 0.7766, far above the significance level of 0.05. So we can't reject the Null hypothesis.     
Hence there's no statistical difference between both means.

We get the same result if we do a T-test with a smaller sample of 30.

The suspension coilâ€™s pound-per-inch results are statistically similar from the mean population results
of 1,500 pounds per inch.


# Design our Own Study

We've been tasked with designing a study comparing the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle with
other vehicles on the market.

## numerical metrics of interest        
        - fuel efficiency mpg
        - max speed
        - acceleration (seconds to 60mph)
        - cost of vehicle (if not considered into price categories)

For the numerical continuous values, we'll perform 2-samples T-test when comparing the population/sample of MechaCars
with population/sample of market vehicles.

Our main question is if there's statistical Difference between the 2 groups, and we hope to show that there will be 
statistical difference, and that the MechaCar protoypes will get better/higher metrics, i.e. a higher mpg,
a higher max speed, a lower acceleration.

The Null Hypothesis is that there's no statistical difference - meaning that the MechaCar prototypes can't be proven to have 
better (or worse) metrics. And the Alternative Hypothesis is that there's a statistical difference.


## categorical metrics of intererst        
        - cost of vehicle (could be considered categorical if we consider price categories)
        - security features
        - style (color)
        - options (gps)

For the categorical metrics, we'll perform Chi-squared tests where we compare frequency data.

The Null Hypothesis says that there's no statistical difference between the 2 groups (population or samples, depending on the
metrics). The Alternative Hypothesis (that we hope to prove) says that there's a statistical difference.

When comparing price categories, we may have to compare different groups depending on the same engine, style,
features, options, etc... so we may perform ANOVA tests among these different grouips as well.
